collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/forest-management-mapping
excerpt: 'This study analyzed how carbon storage and water yield ecosystem service hotspots align with forest management types in the Southeastern United States and Pacific Northwest using InVEST and GIS modeling. Results show limited overlap between services and reveal regional differences in which management strategies most effectively support multiple ecosystem benefits, informing large-scale forest planning and conservation.'
