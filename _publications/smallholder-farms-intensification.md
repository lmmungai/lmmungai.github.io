excerpt: 'This study examines smallholder farming practices in Central Malawi, revealing that despite policy efforts to promote sustainable intensification, farmers largely prioritize maize over legumes in resource allocation and soil management. Findings highlight low soil fertility, underutilization of legume residues, and the need for targeted education and extension services to support holistic, resource-efficient farming systems.'
