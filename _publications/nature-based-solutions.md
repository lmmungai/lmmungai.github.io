excerpt: 'This study integrates life cycle assessment, ecological modeling, and land use data to evaluate the global warming potential (GWP) of cropland management at a fine spatial scale. Findings show that management intensity—particularly fertilizer and fuel production—drives emissions more than land extent, emphasizing the need to consider upstream processes in nature-based solutions (NbS) for climate mitigation.'
