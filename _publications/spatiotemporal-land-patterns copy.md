title: "Modeling Spatiotemporal Patterns of Land Use/Land Cover Change in Central Malawi Using a Neural Network Model"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/spatiotemporal-land-patterns
excerpt: 'This study analyzes land use and land cover change in Dedza and Ntcheu districts of Central Malawi using satellite imagery and a neural network model to identify key drivers such as elevation, population density, and proximity to infrastructure. Results show agriculture will increasingly dominate the landscape by 2050, highlighting the need for locally informed, multi-dimensional land management and conservation policies.'
