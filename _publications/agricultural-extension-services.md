excerpt: 'This study explores the perspectives of agricultural extension staff in central Malawi, highlighting the diverse actors involved in service delivery—including government, NGOs, and farmer groups—and the tools they use, from printed manuals to mobile apps like WhatsApp. Key findings point to the need for stronger public-private collaboration, expanded advisory topics (such as climate change adaptation), and the integration of digital communication tools to improve farmer outreach and support.'
