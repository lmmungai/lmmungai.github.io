permalink: /publication/agricultural-productivity-trends
excerpt: 'This study analyzes spatial trends in Malawian agricultural productivity from 2006 to 2017 using MODIS-NDVI data and household survey data to isolate the effects of weather, soil, and farmer management practices. Findings reveal that many areas of agricultural intensification are not fully explained by biophysical factors, and overall maize yields have declined, particularly in southern Malawi.'
