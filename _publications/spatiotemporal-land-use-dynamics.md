title: "Spatial-temporal modeling of land-use dynamics at the agricultural-forest interface: insights from Ntchisi District, Malawi"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/spatiotemporal-land-use-dynamics
excerpt: 'This study analyzes land-use and forest degradation in Ntchisi District, Malawi, using satellite imagery and machine learning models, revealing major shifts from tree cover, shrubland, and wetlands to cropland between 2015 and 2022. Projections for 2030 indicate continued tree cover loss—even in reserves—driven by population density, proximity to villages, roads, and terrain, offering key insights for targeted restoration strategies.'
