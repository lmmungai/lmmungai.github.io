I am a human geographer trained in agroecology and geospatial science. My research interest is understanding human-environment interactions in agricultural systems across geographic scales. I apply geographic and agroecology principles to understand farmer practices and biophysical factors that influence productivity such as weather, soil, input resources and land use changes.

To analyze basic research questions, I use mixed methods, including quantitative and qualitative approaches as well as surveys and long-term datasets, such as satellite imagery for generalizable and predictive modeling.
