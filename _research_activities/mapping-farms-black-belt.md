This project was funded in 2024 by The College Academy of Research, Scholarship, and Creative Activity (CARSCA) of The University of Alabama with collaborations with Dr. Nicholas Magliocca. The aim is to develop spatial and cognitive archetypes of small-scale, underserved farms in the Black Belt region of Alabama to serve as an entry point to unravelling farm variability in resources and management to contribute to targeting of site-specific resources that can optimize productivity [Manuscript in preparation].
